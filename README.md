# Genetic Algorithm 

### About the Project
This project implement a Generic Algorithm (GA) in Python 3. 

### Build with
The following modules were used to this implementation
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [ABC](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html)
- [Time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)


### Getting Started
Make sure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) installed to run this project.

Numpy can be installed using pip
> pip install numpy

Additionally instalation will not be necessary.

### Usage

This project contains three files:
- geneticAlgorithm.py: This file has a class with the same name which implements all the necessary methods from a GA.
- implementedGeneticAlgorithm.py: a GA can be use different fitness function. This file has the implementation of one specific fitness function used during the execution of the algorithm. 
- geneticAlgorithmExecution: call the fitness function implementation used in this project.

In order to use it, you should download this file and: 

1. Create an instance of the FitnessFunctionImplementationOfGA and execute the method execute() it with all the necessary parameters; or
2. Create a new class to implement a new fitness function. In this case, the new class must inherit the GeneticAlgorithm class and implements the method fitnessFunction

### Parameters

| Parameters | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
|populationNumber| Number of chromossomes in one population |
|numberOfParents| Number of parents that should selected |
|numberOfIterations| Maximum number of iterations the algorithm should run  |
|maxNumberOfRepetition| Maximum number of chromossome repetition considered to finalize the GA execution|
|KIndividuals | Number of individuals selected in the tournament selection |
|KChildren | number of children generated by the cross over |
|CrossOverThr | set the cross over threshold which says when the cross over operations should occur for two specific parents|
|filename | set the name of the results file
### Example

```sh
from implementedGeneticAlgorithm import FitnessFunctionImplementationOfGA'
a = FitnessFunctionImplementationOfGA()
a.execute(20,4,350,10,4,4,0.5,'results_20.txt')
```
